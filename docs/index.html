# Revisor
## About
Revisor is a python-powered server and python library are useful for:
1. Deploy models code to server and get the predictions,
2. Control version of model, which is responsible for predictions,
3. Log and visualize intermediate results and view them on server,
4. Publish data with markdown- and vega-lite-based dashboards.
## Installation
1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/timeseries-ru/revisor): `git clone https://github.com/timeseries-ru/revisor`,
2. Execute install scripts in appropriate project subfolder, batch or shell (depending on your platform).
3. Start serve.sh/.bat or set your wsgi/supervisor to control the waitress/gunicorn server instances.
You may like to change the settings, but in case of gunicorn, don't turn off the `preload`.

Default name/password for access to server UI is admin/admin, for dashboards: user/user. You can change them
in server/users.py file manually.

## Quickstart example
Once the server is started and library is installed, you are able to push models to server from code.
```python
import revisor as rv

# Wrapper is mandatory when you use revisor in jupyter notebook environment
def ClassWrapper():
  class Implementation:
    def task(self, model):
      print("Code will print this text every minute")
    def fit(self, model):
      import revisor # you'll need to reimport modules
      print("Code can be called using API or server UI")
      yield revisor.Message().text("Text to be logged")
    def predict(self, model, array):
      print("Code can be called using API")
      return reversed(array)
  return Implementation

project = rv.Project("Project Name", "http://running.server.url")
model = rv.Model("Model name")

# Deploy model and implementation to the server with task calls support
project.deploy(model, ClassWrapper, 'your token from server UI', schedule=True)
```

Once you pushed your code, the project will be created with first version of model. You can navigate them in UI,
also with viewing the pushed implementation.

## Library API
Library API exposes 3 classes: Project, Model and Message. One project contains one or more model versions,
with independent implementation, logs and visualizations.

Each project has current version of model, which is used by default for predictions and periodical tasks.
You need to change the current version of model in project explicitly in UI or by code call. Also, each
project exposes one dashboard, the HTML-page based on markdown and vega-lite charts.

More about methods of each class you may found in repository [README](https://github.com/timeseries-ru/revisor/blob/master/README.md).
Also it is good to have a look through the [samples code](https://github.com/timeseries-ru/revisor/tree/master/samples).

## Server JSON predict API

Post with Cookie token (='your token') to the url

`
/projects/Your Project Name/predict/{optionally_give_a_model_version_number}
`

to call the predict method of your model. The data two ways is passed as JSON array in body.

## Server dashboards

Project's dashboard may contain markdown text, where all contents in triple backticks will be interpreted as
vega-lite specification of chart. You will need to pass the data in it explicitly.

```markdown
...use triple backticks
{
  "width": 1000,
  "height": 250,
  "selection": {
    "grid": {
      "type": "interval", "bind": "scales"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "values": [{"X": 1, "Y": 2}, {"X": 2, "Y": 4}, {"X": 3, "Y": 1}]
  },
  "mark": "point",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "X", "type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"field": "Y", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
...close triple backticks

```

Will render to the next chart.
```
{
  "width": 1000,
  "height": 250,
  "selection": {
    "grid": {
      "type": "interval", "bind": "scales"
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "values": [{"X": 1, "Y": 2}, {"X": 2, "Y": 4}, {"X": 3, "Y": 1}]
  },
  "mark": "point",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "X", "type": "quantitative"},
    "y": {"field": "Y", "type": "quantitative"}
  }
}
```

When you start with five symbols as 'data:' your triple backtikcs content, then it will be replaced
to "CSV" hyperlink for downloading raw csv contents (in triple backticks provided).

## Server tasks
Server tasks (if they are) will be executed every minute in one separate thread.
Hence, be careful with matplotlib for example, cause it's backends may demand main thread to run.

## What's next?

*Start to use Revisor*. It is ok for regular analytical tasks and reports.
It is not tested on high performance or high load environments though.

You may use it for such cases as:
1. Getting data from DB and reporting it on dashboard,
2. Fitting and managing models on server and get its predictions,
3. Share your data explorations with your team.

Also, if you have an issue found - please fill in it on github.
